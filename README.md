# NMEA2k_Probe
Plug into an established NMEA2k bus via the M12 connector and allow for probing of signals via oscillcope.

# Jumpers available:
  1. Add 120 Ohm resistor accross CANH and CANL lines to act as a terminaiting resistor.
  2. Connect shield within cable to GND (this should only occur at 1 node).

# New Design
I realised that J1 (A12D-M105HPRR) was difficult to procure, so I changed it to Phoenix Contact 1553048 which is available on Digikey.
